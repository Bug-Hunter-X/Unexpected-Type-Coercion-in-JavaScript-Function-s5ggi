This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle bug in JavaScript related to type coercion. The function `foo` is intended to add two numbers; however, it unexpectedly concatenates a string and number if a string is provided as input instead of returning an error or null. This can lead to unexpected behavior in applications and is a good example of why robust input validation is essential.
